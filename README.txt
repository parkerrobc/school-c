The files of true concern are homework-4.c and homework-4.h; menu.c and menu.h are for user input purposes only and are currently limited to size and int arrays for input.

How to compile:
(Instructions are written for linux distributions using the clang complier)

tar -xvzf menu.tar.gz menu
clang -o main menu/*.c
